# Serverless To-Do App
A serverless todo app built with AWS Amplify to learn the basics of using the Amplify CLI to create full-stack serverless projects with React, GraphQL, and DynamoDB.

## Motivation
The serverless To-Do App is my first real experience utlizing the Amplify CLI to easily interface with AWS resources such as Auth (Cognito), API (GraphQL with DynamoDB), and Hosting (S3). The AWS CLI is extremely powerful and helped to create an app that is much simpler to maintain than the [mern-shopping-list](https://github.com/msichterman/mern-shopping-list) that I created with the MERN stack in the past. This experience opened the door to my love for AWS Amplify, a tool I will continute to use to create performant and easily maintainable full-stack serverless applications.
